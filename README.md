Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.

Example:

Prompt: what's on your mind today?
Input: well, it's just a day for me to be an expert in coding
Output: oh nice, you just told me what's on your mind in 13 words!
To take this a step further, open a file that is handed to you, count the number of words in there, then print it out.
